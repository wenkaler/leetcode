Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

    Input: 123
    Output: 321
    Example 2:

    Input: -123
    Output: -321
    Example 3:

    Input: 120
    Output: 21
    
>Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
